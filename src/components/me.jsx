          <p>
            I grew up in a small town in Morocco, where there was little
            entertainment and few opportunities for sports. Life was simple, and
            adventure seemed far away.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everything changed when I lost my mother unexpectedly at the age of
            20. Her passing was a turning point in my life. I promised myself
            that the best prayer I could offer for her soul was to become a
            better version of myself every single day.
