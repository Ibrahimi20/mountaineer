          welcome to my mountaineering journeys
        </h1>

        <p>
          I grew up in a small town in Morocco, where there was little
          entertainment and few opportunities for sports. Life was simple, and
          adventure seemed far away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everything changed when I lost my mother unexpectedly at the age of
          20. Her passing was a turning point in my life. I promised myself that
          the best prayer I could offer for her soul was to become a better
          version of myself every single day.
        </p>

        <p>Welcome to my My mountaineering journey.</p>
